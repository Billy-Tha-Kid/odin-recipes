        <p>There’s no such thing as an all-encompassing “best lasagna recipe.” Sometimes only a full-on cooking project with layers of creamy béchamel and Bolognese will do. Or, you may crave the rich comfort only a good homemade lasagna can bring, but prefer to keep it meat-free. And then there are the nights you want a version like this: An easy crowd-pleasing lasagna with layers of no-boil noodles, a luscious ricotta cheese mixture, and a streamlined meat sauce that comes to the table bubbling and burnished in a casserole dish big enough to feed a crowd.</p>
        <p>While many lasagna recipes call for adding an assortment of meats (like ground beef, pork, or veal, among others), this one simplifies the sauce, using just fennel-scented spicy Italian sausage. Feel free to swap in sweet Italian sausage if you prefer, or an Italian American–style turkey sausage if you don’t eat pork. The other secret is adding a can of tomatoes with peppers and onions, creating a flavorful, meaty tomato sauce with minimal prep time. As for the cheese mixture, there are no shortcuts: Grating fresh mozzarella and a block of Parmesan on the coarse side of a box grater takes more effort than grabbing preshredded versions at the grocery store but makes a world of difference in flavor and texture.</p>
        <p>Serve your lasagna with a loaf of garlic bread and a bottle of red wine. Leftovers can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container and will reheat beautifully.</p>

        <p>   </p>
        <h4>Assembly</h4>

            <li>12 no-boil lasagna noodles (from one 8-oz. package)</li>
            <li>12 oz. low-moisture mozzarella cheese, coarsely grated (about 3 cups)</li>

        </ul></p>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>   </p>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Warm <strong>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</strong> in a large Dutch oven or other heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Cook <strong>1 lb. spicy Italian sausage, casings removed, 1 medium onion, finely chopped, 3 large garlic cloves, chopped, 2 tsp. dried oregano</strong>, and <strong>¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</strong>, stirring often and breaking up sausage into small pieces, until sausage is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Add one 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes with added purée and one 14.5-oz. can diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions. Bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors are melded, about 5 minutes. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p>
        <p><strong>Do Ahead:</strong> Sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.</p>

        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <p>   </p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>Pulse <storng>1½ cups (packed) fresh basil leaves</storng> in a food processor until finely chopped. Add <strong>1 large egg, one 15-oz. container plus 1 cup part-skim ricotta cheese, 6 oz. low-moisture mozzarella cheese, coarsely grated (about 1½ cups), 2 oz. Parmesan cheese, coarsely grated (about ¾ cup), ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt</strong>, and <strong>¼ tsp. freshly ground black pepper</strong>. Pulse until combined but still a little chunky.</p>

        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat oven to 375°. Spread 1¼ cups of meat sauce in a 13x9" glass baking dish. Arrange <strong>3 no-boil lasagna noodles</strong> in a single layer over sauce. Spoon 1½ cups ricotta mixture over the layer of noodles and spread it from edge to edge. Scatter <strong>¾ cup coarsely grated low-moisture mozzarella cheese</strong> and <strong>¼ cup coarsely grated Parmesan cheese</strong> evenly over. Starting with another layer of sauce, repeat process 2 more times. Arrange remaining 3 noodles on top; spread remaining sauce over the noodles. Scatter remaining mozzarella and Parmesan evenly over.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>  </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Coat a large piece of foil with <strong>nonstick cooking spray</strong>. Cover lasagna with foil, coated side down, and bake 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400°. Carefully remove foil from lasagna and continue to bake until edges are golden and puffed, noodles are tender, and tomato sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes longer. Let cool 15 minutes before serving.</p>
        <p><strong>Do Ahead:</strong>Lasagna can be assembled 3 days in advance. Refrigerate unbaked in lasagna pan or freeze for up to 3 months. Bake frozen lasagna as above, adding 10–15 minutes onto the cook time before removing foil.</p>
