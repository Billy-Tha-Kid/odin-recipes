        <p>Double chocolate brownies from scratch recipe that are easy, tasty, and the absolute best way to cure your chocolate craving. We used Ghiradelli chocolate chips and Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate bars for this one. You can make these brownies with frosting if you'd like for more of a cake experience.</p>
        <p>I was craving a really chocolatey, ooey, gooey, chocolate chip filled double chocolate brownie today, and boy, am I glad I made this recipe. It definitely fit the bill.</p>
        <p>The texture of the brownie inside is chewy and fudgy, the top has the perfect crackle and the insides are filled with melting chocolate chips. Simply decadent.</p>
        <p><ul><li>Salted Butter</li>
            <li>Two Semi-Sweet 4 oz chocolate bars (I used Ghiradelli), chopped</li>
            <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>Light or Dark Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>3 Eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>All-purpose Flour</li>
            <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips</ul></p>

            <p>I really, really love the crackly tops on these brownies. Perfection. This time, I used Ghiradelli chocolate disks instead of chips and they worked really well.</p>

            <h4>How to make Double Chocolate Brownies?</h4>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Melt chocolate and butter in a saucepan over medium heat until smooth and melted. Remove from heat and cool in a mixing bowl for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line an 8x8 baking dish with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Whisk in granulated and brown sugars to chocolate/butter mixture. Add eggs, one at a time, whisking well until smooth. Whisk in vanilla.</li>
                <li>Add in flour, cocoa powder, and salt, slowly, just until combined.</li>
                <li>Fold in chocolate chips.</li>
                <li>Cook for 34-37 minutes in the preheated oven.</li>
            </ol></p>
            
            <h4>How do you know when fudge brownies are done?</h4>
            <p>When you insert a toothpick in the center of the brownies and there are a few moist crumbs on the toothpick, your brownies are done. If there is still wet dough clinging to the toothpick, the brownies need to cook longer (at least a few more minutes).</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy these decadent treats as much as we did. Here's to a double dose of chocolate!</p>
