        <p>Double chocolate brownies from scratch recipe that are easy, tasty, and the absolute best way to cure your chocolate craving. We used Ghiradelli chocolate chips and Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate bars for this one. You can make these brownies with frosting if you'd like for more of a cake experience.</p>
        <p>I was craving a really chocolatey, ooey, gooey, chocolate chip filled double chocolate brownie today, and boy, am I glad I made this recipe. It definitely fit the bill.</p>
        <p>The texture of the brownie inside is chewy and fudgy, the top has the perfect crackle and the insides are filled with melting chocolate chips. Simply decadent.</p>
        <p><ul><li>Salted Butter</li>
            <li>Two Semi-Sweet 4 oz chocolate bars (I used Ghiradelli), chopped</li>
            <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>Light or Dark Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>3 Eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>All-purpose Flour</li>
            <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips</ul></p>

            <p>I really, really love the crackly tops on these brownies. Perfection. This time, I used Ghiradelli chocolate disks instead of chips and they worked really well.</p>
